This folder contains some useful programs for one to compute linear programming
Simplex methods have both primal and dual version, and the inputs can be changed by unsers

solver.py includes several useful solvers to compute answers in linear equations
compacted matrix program is also developed to compress large matrix with highly sparse systems
